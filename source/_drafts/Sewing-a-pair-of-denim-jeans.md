For many who know me off the interwebz know I have a certain, style, of a t-shirt and jeans; sometimes a jacket if I'm really pushing the boat out. And whilst I am trying to push the boat out by branching out into dresses and skirts, jeans are just easy.

I have a pair that my mum made me(with a little help from me, emphasis on *little*) back in 2016 and they are starting to show signs of wear. Also I'm gaining weight thanks to some antidepressants' side effects so they're getting a little tight on the hips. I have the pattern(thanks mum ðŸ’–) and now that I have an overlocker I feel that I'm in a good place to finally make them myself.

So, with no major hiccups I have all the pieces cut out

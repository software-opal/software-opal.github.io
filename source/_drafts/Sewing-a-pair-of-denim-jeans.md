For many who know me off the interwebz know I have a certain "style" of a t-shirt and jeans; sometimes a jacket if I'm really pushing the boat out. And whilst I am trying branching out into dresses and skirts, jeans are just easy.

I have a pair that my mum made me(with a little help from me, emphasis on *little*) back in 2016 and they are starting to show signs of wear. Also I'm gaining weight thanks to some antidepressants' side effects so they're getting a little tight on the hips. I have the pattern(thanks mum ðŸ’–) and now that I have an overlocker I feel that I'm in a good place to finally make them myself.

I'm adding 1 inch to each side-seam(so 4 extra inches in waist and 2 in each leg); and I'm also adding 2.5 inches in the leg to accomidate a larger hem and longer leg. As an aside I've found this "Seams Right" to be an invaluable tool; I found it in one of my local quilting shops(hence the inches); a metric one would be amazing.

So, with no major hiccups I have all the pieces cut out of denim. Tomorrow I'll be cutting out the remaining pieces from a accent piece.

Not much done; tested out some serger settings; needed to increase the tension on the lower looper as they were coming around to the front. Also realised I'm missing a Jeans needle which is going to mean a trip to Spotlight tomorrow or Saturday.

I'm so thankful that my mum transcribed the instructions; so much easier to follow than the whole-'nother-language that is sewing instructions. Also; having an already-made version makes figuring out what goes where and in what order so nice and easy

Finally ready to start sewing this all together. Got a jeans needle, which is a stronger variant of a regular needle; and whilst I was out I also grabbed a top stitching needle because I was having trouble with the top-stitching not sitting 'correctly' in the fabric. That needle didn't help.

So with a nice length top stitch: The left is 2.2 mm, the machine's default, and too short in my opinion. The right is 3.0mm which I think is much nicer. 

And after getting the pockets all ready I realized that I didn't add an inch to the side of the pocket elements. So I'm going to have to re-cut the pocket facing and possibly the pocket bag.

Pocket bag, check. Pocket facing, check. And they all got stitched together as per the instructions.

So with the pocket bag stitched to each front leg I moved on to the next task - the fly. The instructions were relatively easy to follow(after I read them about 10 times).

Had some issues with top stitching that I don't really know how to solve. The machine would get stuck as I was close to the edge of the fabric. I decided to clean the machine by taking the stitching plate off and giving underneath a good clean. Seemed to help.

Called my Mum to show off my new overlocker and pick her brain on the sewing machine-eating-fabric problem.

Am I happy with the finishes? sorta. I've been able to throw this nagging perfectionism to the wind, and sure my jeans aren't going to look perfect; but they are mine and that is what matters

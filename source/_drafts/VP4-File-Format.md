title: VP4 File Format

In the absence of any information in the great fountian of knowledge that is the internet I am going to reverse engineer the `VP4` file format.

`VP4` is a file format designed for PFAFF embroidery machines([source](https://forum.embroideres.com/announcement/3-vp4-pfaff-embroidery-format/)). It appears both in name and content to be based off the previous VP3 file format that was documented by [Jason Weiler](http://www.jasonweiler.com/VP3FileFormatInfo.html)(also ). 

For this investigation I will be using [this lovely pattern](https://forum.embroideres.com/files/file/2432-blue-flower-and-green-leaf-free-embroidery-design/) which is avaliable for free in a wide variety of formats(thank you ðŸ’–). The two pictures below show the pattern in all it's glory.
